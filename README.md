# Data Structure and Algorithms in Ruby

This repository holds a collection of algorithms written using Ruby programming language.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Clone or download this repository to your local workstation.

### Prerequisites

Since all the code is written using ruby `Ruby Runtime >= 1.9` is required to interpret the code. if you don't have ruby runtime installed on your computer
follow the instruction for your specific operating system on the [official installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

### Usage

After you have downloaded and have a local copy on your computer, open the folder using your terminal/commandline window and run

`ruby <name-of-ruby-script>.rb`

where `name-of-ruby-script` is any ruby file contained inside the folder.

## Contents
**1.0 Bubble Sort**

  One of the simpler (but more processor-intensive) ways of sorting a group of items in an array is bubble sort, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.
  This algorithm is optimized to always ignore the last element upon completion of the first iteration. 
  Another check is also put in place to determine if the array of elements is already sorted or not. If already sorted, the algorithm returns the original array.
